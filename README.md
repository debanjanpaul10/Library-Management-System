# Library-Management-System
A Library Management System made with C that stores data in a binary folder.
This project is made with the basics of C and file I/O where a binary file is used for both storing the login details as well as library details.

A user ID and pass is required to login after which we can -->
  1. Add books
  2. Search for books
  3. View all the books
  4. Delete a book detail
  5. Update username password
  
As of version 1.0, the username and password are defaults.
The code has comment lines which makes the program self explanatory.
